Since C does not support to return an array in function, I have to put everything on the main() function,which is kind of stupid. But it's still work though so hahaha.

About the stochastic and mini-batch, the rand() function in C has limited randomness so it could not give a truly random value, which leads to deviations in the method.Correct me if i'm wrong :( I have to use 100000 epochs to get a ideal value so :(

I continue with machine learning 2 in python, after a lot of stupid things in C.
